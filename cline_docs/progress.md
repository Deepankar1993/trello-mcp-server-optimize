# Trello MCP Server - Progress

## What Works

- âœ… **Project Structure**: The project structure has been set up with all necessary files and directories.
- âœ… **Service Layer**: All service classes have been implemented for interacting with the Trello API.
- âœ… **Tool Definitions**: All tool definitions have been created for the MCP server.
- âœ… **Tool Handlers**: All tool handlers have been implemented to connect tools to services.
- âœ… **Configuration**: Configuration system has been set up with environment variables.
- âœ… **Documentation**: Basic documentation has been created in the README.md file.
- âœ… **Optimization Phase 1**: Token usage baseline established and high-token operations identified.
- âœ… **Optimization Phase 2**: ResponseOptimizer implemented with field filtering and presets.
- âœ… **Optimization Phase 3**: Smart defaults, array optimization, and caching layer completed.
- âœ… **Optimization Phase 4**: Response summarization, performance monitoring, and production readiness completed.
- âœ… **Optimization Phase 5**: Quality assurance completed with all tests passing and performance validated.

## What's Left to Build

- ðŸ”„ **Testing**: Need to test all tools with actual Trello API calls.
- âœ… **TypeScript Errors**: Fixed TypeScript errors in the index.ts and base-service.ts files.
- âœ… **Build Process**: Successfully built and ran the server.
- ðŸ”„ **Error Handling**: Need to improve error handling for specific Trello API errors.
- ðŸ”„ **Rate Limiting**: Need to implement rate limiting to avoid hitting Trello API limits.
- ðŸ”„ **Authentication Improvements**: Need to add support for OAuth authentication.
- ðŸ”„ **Additional Tools**: Consider adding more specialized tools for specific Trello workflows.
- âœ… **Detailed Documentation**: Updated with Phase 4 features and performance report.
